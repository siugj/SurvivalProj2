ii.	Use Schoenfeld residuals to evaluate the proportional hazards assumption for age

 assuming that all variables but age and sho are known to satisfy the proportional 
 assumption. Both Pearson’s correlation coefficient test and graphical approach 
 (i.e a Loess curve using Proc SGPlot) are required to show whether the Schoenfeld 
 residuals are independent of ranked log-transformed failure time variables (10 points). 
 Develop a null hypothesis for each variable (4 points).  Interpret plots results and 
 the statistical results and draw your conclusion if age and sho meet the proportional
  hazards assumption for both outcomes (8 points).
